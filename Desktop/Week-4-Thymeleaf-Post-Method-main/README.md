## Lab 2 Assignment

### CreateFighterController Implementation with Form Validation

Implement a `CreateFighterController` with POST method to process fighter registration and add it to the fighter pool (list of fighters similar to what we did in class with players).

#### Requirements

##### Controller Implementation
- **Implement `createFighter()` method** with POST signature
  - Handle form submissions from the fighter registration form
  - Add submitted fighters to the fighter pool (list)
  - Redirect on successful submission

##### Validation Requirements
- **All fields required:** name, health, damage, resistance
- **Health validation:** Must be more than 1000 but less than 1500
- **Damage validation:** Must be less than 100
- **Resistance validation:** Must be from 0 to 10 and must be a double value

##### Form & Display
- **CreateFighter Template:** 
  - Create a registration form that guides users to fix validation issues
  - Display validation error messages on the form
 
- **FighterController:**
  - Create a new `FighterController` that renders fighters in a table
  - Display all registered fighters similar to what we did with Players
  - Table should show: name, health, damage, resistance

##### Testing
- Ensure validation is properly working on form submission
- Test all validation scenarios
- Verify fighters are added to the list successfully
